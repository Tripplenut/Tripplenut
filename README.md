# Hi, I'm Anthony Fabius ðŸ‘‹

A banner goes here eventually ðŸ’€

Hello! I'm Anthony, a junior computer science student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, passionate about building cool open-source software and diving deep into computer science theory. 

### ðŸ”­Currently Working On

Most of my time goes towards working on [ParadiseOS](https://github.com/ParadiseOS/ParadiseOS), which is a lightweight 32-bit x86 multi-core operating system open-source operating system currently in development. Aside from that, I am currently developing a graph library in Rust and learning about compiler optimization.

### ðŸ“š Learning

At Rensselaer, I'm delving deep into the realms of algorithms and computational theory. I am currently engaged in collaborative research with [Dr.George Slota](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~slotag/), exploring innovative methods in graph generation.

### ðŸ’‚Personal Interests

Aside from being a professional procrastinator when I'm not buried in coursework, you can find me listening to the math rock, fencing, or cooking!
